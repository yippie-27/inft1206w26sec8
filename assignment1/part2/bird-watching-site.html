        <p>
          Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site, it
          would be the ideal place to come to learn more about birdwatching,
          whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to get into birding, or
          an expert wanting to share ideas, tips, and photos with other
          like-minded people.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          So don't waste time! Get what you need, then turn off that computer and
          get out into the great outdoors!
